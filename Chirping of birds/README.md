## Challenge Description

The parrot has been saying   qx%$r%uL!#b%%*0bc$*0d%&uuN  since morning. It must have said it at least 47 times till now. At this point it is pretty annoying. Can someone help me figure out what it's saying?

## Writeup

The given string was encoded using ROT-47 cipher. ParROT was indicative of ROT and 47 meant ROT 47. So if we decode the string given, we get the flag.

## Flag

```
BITSCTF{PR3TTY_34SY_5TUFF}
```
